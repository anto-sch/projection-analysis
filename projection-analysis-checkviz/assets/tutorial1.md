## Part 1: Introduction to Scatterplots and Clusters

### What is a Scatterplot?
A scatterplot is a type of chart that shows individual data points as dots. Each dot represents one data item and its position is determined by two values—one on the horizontal (X) axis and one on the vertical (Y) axis. This way, you can see patterns in the data, including how things are related.

### What are Clusters?
Clusters are groups of points that are close together in the scatterplot. These groups often represent data points that have something in common or are similar to each other.

### What is the Density of a Cluster?
Density refers to how tightly packed the points are in a cluster. A dense cluster has many points close together; a sparse cluster has points that are spread apart.
