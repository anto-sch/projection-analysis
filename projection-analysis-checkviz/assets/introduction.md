## Study on Enhancing Scatterplots for High-Dimensional Data Analysis

In this study, we are exploring how **adding background information to scatterplots** can make it easier to visually analyze complex, high-dimensional data. You’ll start with a short tutorial explaining how to understand the visualization and use the interface. After that, you’ll complete five quick data analysis tasks using the tool.

Please note that you can terminate the experiment any time. After reading and consenting to the following terms of the study, the experiment will begin.

Your demographic data (age, gender, occupation), your answers to all questions, and your reaction times will be recorded in anonymized form. The anonymized data will be analyzed and possibly shared in an openly available data repository alongside the publication of the results in a scientific journal or conference proceeding.
