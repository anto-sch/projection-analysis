## Part 4: How to Use the User Interface

For each task, you will start by solving it using only the scatterplot. After that, you’ll do the same task again—this time with both the scatterplot and the background color map (layout enrichment) available.

### Distance and Density Tasks
For these tasks, clusters are already labeled for you (points in the same cluster have the same color).

- **Answering Questions:** Select which clusters you think fit the task description (e.g., “Which cluster is densest?”) using the provided answer options.

### Summary
- Use the scatterplot to look for patterns.
- The matrix visualization of the clusters helps you understand the *true* relationships in the data.
- Follow the simple interface instructions for different tasks.
- Remember: The scatterplot is a helpful tool, but the matrix gives you the full picture!
