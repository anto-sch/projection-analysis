## Part 4: How to Use the User Interface

For each task, you will start by solving it using only the scatterplot. After that, you’ll do the same task again—this time with both the scatterplot and the background color map (layout enrichment) available.

### Different Task Types
You may be asked to do different types of tasks, such as identifying clusters or comparing distances and densities.

### A. Cluster Identification Tasks
Here you will pick out clusters that you see in the scatterplot.

**How to Do Cluster Selection:**
1. **Use the Brush Tool:** Drag the brush over points to select a cluster.
2. **Add Multiple Clusters:** After selecting a cluster, click the 'Add Cluster' button before you select another one.
3. **Reset Selection:** If you want to start over, click 'Clear Selection' to remove all current selections.

### B. Distance and Density Tasks
For these, clusters are already labeled for you (points in the same cluster have the same color).

- **Answering Questions:** Select which clusters you think fit the task description (e.g., “Which cluster is densest?”) using the provided answer options.

### C. Viewing the Layout Enrichment More Clearly

You can switch the data points in the scatterplot on or off. This lets you see the background color map (layout enrichment) more clearly, without the points. Use the toggle button provided in the interface to hide or show the data points as needed.

### Summary
- Use the scatterplot to look for patterns.
- The background color map helps you understand the *true* relationships in the data.
- Toggle the data points to see the layout enrichment more clearly.
- Follow the simple interface instructions for different tasks.
- Remember: The scatterplot is a helpful tool, but the color map gives you the full picture!
